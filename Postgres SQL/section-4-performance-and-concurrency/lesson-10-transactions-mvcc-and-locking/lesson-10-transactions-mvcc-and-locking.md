# Pre-requisites

Requires: Labs 1-4. Read the Introduction (lessons 0.1 to 0.3) first.

---

# Environment / Dependencies Setup

All connection settings live in **one global `.env` file at the course root** (`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGSSLMODE`). Every notebook loads it with `load_dotenv("../../.env")`, so Jupyter must be started from inside this lesson folder.

One command installs the Python packages:

```
pip install -U "psycopg[binary]" python-dotenv
```

Installing and starting PostgreSQL itself is covered in lesson 0.3 (Setup Guide).
